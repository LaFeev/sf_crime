**Research question:**
*Can we gain insights into the 'where', 'when', and 'why' of crime incidents in SF?*
____
Utilizing the datasf.org's Open Data collection, we start with a large dataset comprising police reports filed between 2018 and present*.  At the time of writing, this dataset is being actively updated and will continue to grow.  There is also an API provided by datasf.org to allow for updating the dataset without re-downloading.  This API can also be used in the future to rebuild the dataset should the original file cease to be hosted.
